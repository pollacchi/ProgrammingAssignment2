## Function to cache the inverse of a matrix

#makeCachematrix creates a special vector,
#which is really a list containing a function to
#set the value of the matrix
#get the value of the matrix
#set the value of the inverse
#get the value of the invers

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inv) i <<- inv
  getinv <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)

}


# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
#makeCacheMatrix above.
#If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
#then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
